        <span className="big">A</span>t this point in the book—if you’ve gone
        through it chapter by chapter—you have learned to do mental addition,
        subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as the art of
        guesstimation, pencil-and-paper mathemagics, and the phonetic code for
        number memory. This chapter is for serious, die-hard mathemagicians who
        want to stretch their minds to the limits of mental calculation. The
        problems in this chapter range from four-digit squares to the largest
        problem I perform publicly—the multiplication of two different
        five-digit numbers.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        In order to do these problems, it is particularly important that you are
        comfortable and reasonably fast using the phonetic code. And even
        though, if you glance ahead in this chapter, the problems seem
        overwhelming, let me restate the two fundamental premises of this book:
        (1) all mental calculation skills can be learned by almost anyone; and
        (2) the key is the simplification of all problems into easier problems
        that can be done quickly. There is no problem in this chapter (or
        anywhere else) that you will encounter (comparable to these) that cannot
        be mastered and <a id="page164"></a>learned through the simplification
        techniques you’ve learned in previous chapters. Because we are assuming
        that you’ve mastered the techniques needed for this chapter, we will be
        teaching primarily by illustration, rather than walking you through the
        problems word for word. As an aid, however, we remind you that many of
        the simpler problems embedded within these larger problems are ones you
        have already encountered in previous chapters. We begin with four-digit
        squares. Good luck!

        <strong>FOUR-DIGIT SQUARES</strong>
      </h2>
      <p className="nonindent">
        As a preliminary skill for mastering four-digit squares, you need to be
        able to do 4-by-1 problems. We break these down into two 2-by-1
        problems, as in the examples below:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="461"

          width="296"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Once you’ve mastered 4-by-1s you’re ready to tackle four-digit squares.
        Let’s square 4,267. Using the same method we used with two-digit and
        three-digit squares, we’ll square the number 4,267 by rounding down by
        267 to 4,000, and up by 267 to 4,534, multiplying 4,534 × 4,000 (a
        4-by-1), and then adding the square of the number you went up and down
        by, or 267<sup className="frac">2</sup>, as illustrated below:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="211"
          src="/images/Benj_9780307347466_epub_318_r1.jpg"
          width="482"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Now, obviously there is a lot going on in this problem. I realize it’s
        one thing to say, “Just add the square of 267” and quite another to
        actually do it and remember what it was you were supposed to add to it.
        First of all, once you multiply 4,534 × 4 to get 18,136, you can
        actually say the first part of the answer out loud: “Eighteen
        million&#160;…” You can do so because the original number is always
        rounded to the nearest thousand. Thus the largest three-digit number you
        will ever square in the next step is 500. The square of 500 is 250,000,
        so as soon as you see that the rest of your answer (in this case,
        136,000) is less than 750,000, you know that the millions digit will not
        change.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page166"></a>Once you’ve said “eighteen million&#160;…,” you need
        to hold on to 136,000 before you square 267. Here’s where our mnemonics
        from the last chapter comes to the rescue! Using the phonetic code, you
        can convert 136 to <em>damage</em> (1 = <em>d</em>, 3 = <em>m</em>, 6 ={" "}
        <em>j</em>). Now you can work on the next part of the problem and just
        remember <em>damage</em> (and that there are three zeros following—this
        will always be the case). If at any time in the computations you forget
        what the original problem is, you can either glance at the original
        number or, if it isn’t written down, ask the audience to repeat the
        problem (which gives the illusion you are starting the problem over from
        scratch when, in fact, you have already done some of the calculations)!
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        You now do the three-digit square just as you learned to do before, to
        get 71,289. I used to have trouble remembering the hundreds digits of my
        answer (2, in this case). I cured this by raising my fingers (two
        fingers here). If you forget the last two digits (89), you can go back
        to the original number (4,267), square its last two digits (67
        <sup className="frac">2</sup> = 4,489), and take the last two digits of
        that.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        To compute the final answer, you now add 71,289 to <em>damage</em>{" "}
        (which translates back to 136,000) resulting in 207,289, which you may
        now say out loud.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Let’s do one more four-digit square—8,431<sup className="frac">2</sup>:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">

      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page167"></a>Without repeating all the detailed steps as we did
        in the last problem, I will point out some of the highlights of this
        problem. After doing the 8 × 8,862 = 70,896, note that 896 is above 750,
        so a carry is possible. In fact, since 431<sup className="frac">2</sup>{" "}
        is greater than 400<sup className="frac">2</sup> = 160,000, there
        definitely will be a carry when you do the addition to the number
        896,000. Hence we can safely say aloud, “Seventy-one million&#160;…” at
        this point.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        When you square 431, you get 185,761. Add the 185 to the 896 to get
        1,081, and say the rest of the answer. But remember that you already
        anticipated the carry, so you just say, “…&#160;81
        thousand&#160;…&#160;761.” You’re done!
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        We illustrate one more fine point with 2,753

        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Since you are rounding up to 3,000, you will be multiplying 3,000 by
        another number in the 2,000s. You could subtract 2,753 − 247 = 2,506,
        but that’s a little messy. To obtain the last three digits, double 753
        to get 1,506. The last three digits of this number, 506, are the last
        three digits of the 2,000 number: 2,506! This works because the two
        numbers being multiplied must add to twice the original number.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Then proceed in the usual manner of multiplying 3,000 × 2,506 =
        7,518,000, convert 518 to the words <em>light off</em>, and say{" "}
        <a id="page168"></a>the first part of the answer out loud as “Seven
        million&#160;…” You can say this with confidence since 518 is below 750,
        so there will not be a carry.

          <strong>Thomas Fuller: Learned Men and Great Fools</strong>

          <span className="dropcaps">I</span>t would be hard to top the physical
          handicap on learning experienced by Helen Keller, though the social
          handicap imposed on Thomas Fuller, born in Africa in 1710, comes
          close. He was not only illiterate; he was forced to work in the fields
          of Virginia as a slave and never received a single day of education.
          The “property” of Mrs. Elizabeth Cox, Thomas Fuller taught himself to
          count to 100, after which he increased his numerical powers by
          counting such items at hand as the grains in a bushel of wheat, the
          seeds in a bushel of flax, and the number of hairs in a cow’s tail
          (2,872).
        </p>
        <p className="textbox1">
          Extrapolating from mere counting, Fuller learned to compute the number
          of shingles a house would need to cover its roof, the number of posts
          needed to enclose it, and other numbers relevant to materials needed
          in construction. His prodigious skills grew, and with them his
          reputation. In his old age, two Pennsylvanians challenged him to
          compute, in his head, numbers that would challenge the best lightning
          calculators. For example, they asked: “Suppose a farmer has six sows,
          and each sow has six female pigs the first year, and they all increase
          in the same proportion, to the end of eight years, how many sows will
          the farmer then have?” The problem can be written as 7
          <sup className="frac">8</sup> × 6, that is, (7 × 7 × 7 × 7 × 7 × 7 × 7
          × 7)X 6. Within ten minutes Fuller gave his response of 34,588,806,
          the correct answer.
        </p>
        <p className="textbox1">
          Upon Fuller’s death in 1790, the <em>Columbian Centinel</em> reported
          that “he could give the number of poles, yards, feet, inches, and
          barleycorns in any given distance, say the diameter of the earth’s
          orbit; and in every calculation he would produce the true answer, in
          less time than ninety-nine men in a hundred would take with their
          pens.” When Fuller was asked if he regretted having never gained a
          traditional education he responded: “No, Massa—it is best I got no
          learning: for many learned men be great fools.”

        We saw in the 2-by-2 multiplication problems that there are several
        different ways to tackle the same problem. The variety of methods
        increases when you increase the number of digits in the problem. In
        3-by-2 multiplication I find that it pays to take a few moments to look

        (5,096 × 7 = 35,672). There are no addition steps and you don’t have to

        Though you will usually break up the three-digit number when using the
        addition method, it occasionally pays to break up the{" "}

        digit of the two-digit number is a 1 or a 2, as in the following

        This reduces the 3-by-2 to a 3-by-1, made especially easy since the
        second multiplication problem involves a 1. Note, too, that we were
        aided in multiplying a 5 by an even number, which produces an extra 0 in
        the answer, so there is only one digit of overlap in the addition
        problem.

        <strong>The Subtraction Method</strong>
      </h3>
      <p className="nonindent">
        As with 2-by-2s, it is sometimes more convenient to solve a 3-by-2 with
        subtraction instead of addition, as in the following problems:{" "}
        <a id="page174"></a>
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">

          width="267"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        By contrast, you can compare the last subtraction method with the
        addition method, below, for this same problem:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img

      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        My preference for tackling this problem would be to use the subtraction
        method because I always try to leave myself with the easiest possible
        addition or subtraction problem at the end. In this case, I’d rather
        subtract 86 than add 344, even though the 2-by-2 multiplication problem
        in the subtraction method above is slightly harder than the one in the
        addition method.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        The subtraction method can also be used for three-digit numbers below a
        multiple of 100 or close to 1,000, as in the next two examples:{" "}

      <p className="indent">
        Finally, in the following illustration we break up the two-digit number
        using the subtraction method. Notice how we subtract 736 by subtracting

        <strong>FIVE-DIGIT SQUARES</strong>
      </h2>
      <p className="nonindent">
        Mastering 3-by-2 multiplication takes a fair amount of practice, but
        once you’ve managed that, you can slide right into doing five-digit
        squares because they simplify into a 3-by-2 problem plus a two-digit
        square and a three-digit square. Watch:
      </p>
      <p className="indent">To square the following number:</p>

        Using the distributive law we can break this down to:

          width="419"

      </div>
      <p className="indent">This can be stated more simply as:</p>
      <p className="center">
        462<sup className="frac">2</sup> 1 million + (46)(792)(2000) + 7922
        <sup className="frac">2</sup>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        But I do not do them in this order. In fact, I start in the middle,
        because the 3-by-2 problems are harder than the two-digit and
        three-digit squares. So in keeping with the principle of getting the
        hard stuff out of the way first, I do 792 × 46 × 2 and attach three
        zeroes on the end, as follows:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="131"

          width="373"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page178"></a>Using the subtraction method, as shown above,
        compute 792 × 46 = 36,432, then double that number to get 72,864. Using
        the phonetic code from the last chapter on the number 864 allows you to
        store this number as 72 <em>Fisher</em>.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        The next step is to do 46<sup className="frac">2</sup> × 1 million,
        which is 2,116,000,000.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">At this point, you can say, “Two billion&#160;…”</p>
      <p className="indent">
        Recalling the 72 of 72 <em>Fisher</em>, you add 116 million to get 188
        million. Before saying this number aloud, you need to check ahead to see
        if there is a carry when adding <em>Fisher</em>, or 864, to 792
        <sup className="frac">2</sup>. Here you don’t actually calculate 792
        <sup className="frac">2</sup>; rather, you determine that its product
        will be large enough to make the 864,000 carry. (You can guesstimate
        this by noting that 800<sup className="frac">2</sup> is 640,000, which
        will easily make the 864,000 carry, thus you bump the 188 up a notch and
        say, “…&#160;189 million.…&#160;”)
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Still holding on to <em>Fisher</em>, compute the square of 792, using
        the three-digit square method (rounding up and down by 8, and so on) to
        get 627,264. Finally, add 627 to <em>Fisher</em>, or 864, to get 1,491.
        But since you already made the carry, drop the 1 and say, “…&#160;491
        thousand 264.”
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Sometimes I forget the last three digits of the answer because my mind
        has been so preoccupied with the larger computations. So before doing
        the final addition I will store the 2 of 264 on my fingers and try to
        remember the 64, which I can usually do because we tend to recall the
        most recent things heard. If this fails, I can come up with the final
        two digits by squaring the final two digits of the original number, 92
        <sup className="frac">2</sup>, or 8,464, the last two digits of which
        are the last two digits I’m looking for: 64. (Alternatively, you can
        convert 264 into a word like <em>nature</em>.)
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        I know this is quite a mouthful. To reiterate the entire problem in a
        single illustration, here is how I computed 46,792

      <p className="indent">Let’s look at another five-digit square example:</p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>
          83,522<sup className="frac">2</sup>
        </strong>

      <p className="indent">As before, we compute the answer in this order:</p>

        </strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        For the first problem, notice that 522 is a multiple of 9. In fact, 522
        = 58 × 9. Treating 83 as 80 + 3, we get:

      <p className="indent">
        Doubling 43,326 results in 86,652, which can be stored as{" "}
        <em>86 Julian</em>. Since 83<sup className="frac">2</sup> = 6,889, we
        can say, “Six billion&#160;…”
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page180"></a>Adding 889 + 86 gives us 975. Before saying 975
        million we check to see if <em>Julian</em> (652,000) will cause a carry
        after squaring 522. Guesstimating 522<sup className="frac">2</sup> as
        about 270,000 (500 × 540), you see it will not carry. Thus you can
        safely say, “…&#160;975 million&#160;…”

      <p className="indent">
        Finally, square 522 in the usual way to get 272,484 and add that to{" "}

        We note here that step 1 in the multiplication problem (600 × 658) is

        just as 876 + 853 = 1729. This is because:

      <p className="center">
        <strong>x + [(x + a) + b] = (x + a) + (x + b)</strong>

        Thus, to obtain the number to be multiplied by 900 (which you know will
        be 800 plus something), you need only look at the last two digits of 76
        + 53 = 129 to determine 829.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        In the next problem, adding 827 + 761 = 1588 tells us that we should

        This method is so effective that if the 3-by-3 problem you are presented
        with has numbers that are not close together, you can sometimes modify
        the problem by dividing one and multiplying the other, both by the same
        number, to bring them closer together. For instance, 672 × 157 can be
        solved by:

        When none of the previous methods work, I look for an addition-method
        possibility, particularly when the first two digits of one of the
        three-digit numbers is easy to work with. For example, in the problem
        below, the 64 of 641 is factorable into 8 × 8, so I would solve the

      <p className="indent">
        In a similar way, in the next problem the 42 of 427 is factorable into 7

        Since addition-method problems can be very strenuous, I usually go out

        factoring method. In fact, that is how I would choose to do it:

      <p className="indent">
        The simplest addition-method problems are those in which one number has

        These problems tend to be so much easier than other addition-method

        The largest problem we will attempt is the mental multiplication of two
        five-digit numbers. To do a 5-by-5, you need to have mastered 2-by-2s,
        2-by-3s, and 3-by-3s, as well as the phonetic code. Now it is just a
        matter of putting it all together. As you did in the five-digit square
        problems, you will use the distributive law to break down the numbers.
        For example:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="46"
          src="/images/Benj_9780307347466_epub_382_r1.jpg"
          width="218"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Based on this you can break down the problem into four easier
        multiplication problems, which I illustrate below in criss-cross fashion
        as a 2-by-2, two 3-by-2s, and finally a 3-by-3, summing the results for
        a grand total. That is,
      </p>
      <p className="indentt">
        <strong>
          (27 × 52) million
          <br />+ [(27 × 196) + (52 × 639)] thousand
          <br />+ (639 × 196)
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page194"></a>As with the five-digit squares, I begin in the
        middle with the 3-by-2s, starting with the harder 3-by-2:
      </p>
      <div className="block">
        <div className="dis_img">
          <img

            width="464"
          />

      <p className="indent">
        Committing 33,228 to memory with the mnemonic <em>Mom, no knife</em>,
        you then turn to the second 3-by-2:
      </p>
      <div className="block">
        <p className="bl_hanging">
          <strong>2. 27 × 196 = 27 × (200 − 4) = 5,400 − 108 = 5,292</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">and add it to the number that you are storing:</p>
      <p className="indent" style={{ marginTop: "1em", marginBottom: "1em" }}>
        <img
          alt=""
          height="74"
          src="/images/Benj_9780307347466_epub_384_r1.jpg"
          width="272"
        />
      </p>
      <p className="indent">for a new total, which we store as:</p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>“Movie lines” (38 million, 520 thousand)</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Holding on to <em>movie lines</em>, compute the 2-by-2:
      </p>
      <div className="block">
        <p className="bl_hanging">
          <strong>4. 52 × 27 = 52 × 9 × 3 = 1,404</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        At this point, you can give part of the answer. Since this 2-by-2
        represents 52 × 27 million, 1,404 represents 1 billion, 404 million.
        Since 404 million will not cause a carry, you can safely say, “One
        billion&#160;…”
      </p>
      <div className="block">
        <p className="bl_hanging">
          <strong>5. 404 + “Movie” (38) = 442</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page195"></a>In this step you add 404 to <em>movie</em> (38) to
        get 442, at which point you can say, “…&#160;442 million.…” You can say
        this because you know 442 will not carry—you’ve peeked ahead at the
        3-by-3 to see whether it will cause 442 to carry to a higher number. If
        you found that it would carry, you would say, “443 million.” But since{" "}
        <em>lines</em> is 520,000 and the 3-by-3 (639 × 196) will not exceed
        500,000 (a rough guesstimate of 600 × 200 = 120,000 shows this), you are
        safe.
      </p>
      <div className="block">
        <p className="bl_hanging">
          <strong>6. 639</strong> × <strong>196 = 639</strong> ×{" "}
          <strong>7</strong> × <strong>7</strong> × <strong>4 = 4,473</strong> ×{" "}
          <strong>7</strong> × <strong>4 = 31,311</strong> ×{" "}
          <strong>4 = 125,244</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        While still holding on to <em>lines</em>, you now compute the 3-by-3
        using the factoring method, to get 125,244. You might convert 244 into a
        word like <em>nearer</em>. The final step is a simple addition of:
      </p>
      <div className="block">
        <p className="bl_hanging">
          <strong>7. 125,244 + “Lines” (520,000)</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        This allows you to say the rest of the answer: “…&#160;645,244.” Since a
        picture is worth a thousand calculations, here’s our picture of how this
        would look:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img

        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page196"></a>I should make a parenthetical note here that I am
        assuming in doing 5-by-5s that you can write down the problem on a
        blackboard or piece of paper. If you can’t, you will have to create a
        mnemonic for each of the four numbers. For example, in the last problem,
        you could store the problem as:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="45"

          width="182"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Then you would multiply <em>lion × jump, dopish × neck, lion × neck</em>
        , and finally <em>dopish × jump</em>. Obviously this would slow you down
        a bit, but if you want the extra challenge of not being able to see the
        numbers, you can still solve the problem.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">We conclude with one more 5-by-5 multiplication:</p>
      <div className="dis_img">

          width="80"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        The steps are the same as those in the last problem. You start with the
        harder 3-by-2 and store the answer with a mnemonic:

      <div className="dis_img">

          width="418"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">Then you compute the other 3-by-2.</p>
      <div className="block">
        <p className="bl_hanging">

        The 2-by-2 gives you the first digit of the final answer, which you can

        The millions digits of the answer involve a carry from 635 to 636,
        because <em>Panama</em> (923) needs only 77,000 to cause it to carry,
        and the 3-by-3 (838 <strong>×</strong> 547) will easily exceed that
        figure. So you say: “…&#160;636 million&#160;…”

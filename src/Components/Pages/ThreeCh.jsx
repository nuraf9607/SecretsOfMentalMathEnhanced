        <span className="big">M</span>athemagics really gets exciting when you
        perform in front of an audience. I experienced my first public
        performance in eighth grade, at the fairly advanced age of thirteen.
        Many mathemagicians begin even earlier. Zerah Colburn (1804–1839), for
        example, reportedly could do lightning calculations before he could read
        or write, and he was entertaining audiences by the age of six! When I
        was thirteen, my algebra teacher did a problem on the board for which
        the answer was 108<sup className="frac">2</sup>. Not content to stop
        there, I blurted out, “108 squared is simply 11,664!”
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        The teacher did the calculation on the board and arrived at the same
        answer. Looking a bit startled, she said, “Yes, that’s right. How did
        you do it?” So I told her, “I went down 8 to 100 and up 8 to 116. I then
        multiplied 116 × 100, which is 11,600, and just added the square of 8,
        to get 11,664.”
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        She had never seen that method before. I was thrilled. Thoughts of
        “Benjamin’s Theorem” popped into my head. I actually believed I had
        discovered something new. When I finally ran across this method a few
        years later in a book by Martin <a id="page54"></a>Gardner on
        recreational math, <em>Mathematical Carnival</em> (1965), it ruined my
        day! Still, the fact that I had discovered it for myself was very
        exciting to me.

        You, too, can impress your friends (or teachers) with some fairly
        amazing mental multiplication. At the end of the last chapter you
        learned how to multiply a two-digit number by itself. In this chapter
        you will learn how to multiply two different two-digit numbers, a
        challenging yet more creative task. You will then try your hand—or, more
        accurately, your brain—at three-digit squares. You do not have to know
        how to do 2-by-2 multiplication problems to tackle three-digit squares,
        so you can learn either skill first.

      </h2>
      <p className="nonindent">
        When squaring two-digit numbers, the method is always the same. When
        multiplying two-digit numbers, however, you can use lots of different
        methods to arrive at the same answer. For me, this is where the fun
        begins.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        The first method you will learn is the “addition method,” which can be
        used to solve all 2-by-2 multiplication problems.
      </p>
      <h3 className="section">
        <strong>The Addition Method</strong>
      </h3>
      <p className="nonindent">
        To use the addition method to multiply any two two-digit numbers, all
        you need to do is perform two 2-by-1 multiplication problems and add the
        results together. For example:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="128"
          src="/Static/images/Benj_9780307347466_epub_104_r1.jpg"
          width="233"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page55"></a>Here you break up 42 into 40 and 2, two numbers that
        are easy to multiply. Then you multiply 40 × 46, which is just 4 × 46
        with a 0 attached, or 1840. Then you multiply 2 × 46 = 92. Finally, you
        add 1840 + 92 = 1932, as diagrammed above.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">Here’s another way to do the same problem:</p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="127"
          src="/Static/images/Benj_9780307347466_epub_105_r1.jpg"
          width="234"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        The catch here is that multiplying 6 × 42 is harder to do than
        multiplying 2 × 46, as in the first problem. Moreover, adding 1680 + 252
        is more difficult than adding 1840 + 92. So how do you decide which
        number to break up? I try to choose the number that will produce the
        easier addition problem. In most cases—but not all—you will want to
        break up the number with the smaller last digit because it usually
        produces a smaller second number for you to add.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">Now try your hand at the following problems:</p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="127"
          src="/Static/images/Benj_9780307347466_epub_106_r1.jpg"
          width="517"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        The last problem illustrates why numbers that end in 1 are especially
        attractive to break up. If both numbers end in the <a id="page56"></a>
        same digit, you should break up the larger number as illustrated below:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="127"
          src="/Static/images/Benj_9780307347466_epub_107_r1.jpg"
          width="234"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        If one number is much larger than the other, it often pays to break up
        the larger number, even if it has a larger last digit. You will see what
        I mean when you try the following problem two different ways:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="128"

          width="503"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Did you find the first method to be faster than the second? I did.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Here’s another exception to the rule of breaking up the number with the
        smaller last digit. When you multiply a number in the fifties by an even
        number, you’ll want to break up the number in the fifties:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="128"

          width="234"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page57"></a>The last digit of the number 84 is smaller than the
        last digit of 59, but if you break up 59, your product will be a
        multiple of 100, just as 4200 is, in the example above. This makes the
        subsequent addition problem much easier.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">Now try an easy problem of a different sort:</p>
      <div className="dis_img">

      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Though the calculation above is pretty simple, there is an even{" "}
        <em>easier</em> and <em>faster</em> way to multiply any two-digit number
        by 11. This is mathemagics at its best: you won’t believe your eyes when
        you see it (unless you remember it from{" "}

        )!
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Here’s how it works. Suppose you have a two-digit number whose digits
        add up to 9 or less. To multiply this number by 11, merely add the two
        digits together and insert the total between the original two digits.
        For example, to do 42 × 11, first do 4 + 2 = 6. If you place the 6
        between the 4 and the 2, you get 462, the answer to the problem!

      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        You may wonder what happens when the two numbers add up to a number
        larger than 9. In such cases, increase the tens digit by 1, then insert
        the last digit of the sum between the two numbers, as before. For
        example, when multiplying 76 × 11, 7 + 6 = 13, you increase the 7 in 76
        to 8, and then insert the 3 between the 8 and the 6, giving you 836, the
        final answer. See the diagrammed answer below:

        Once you get the hang of this trick, you will never multiply by 11 any

        Returning to the addition method, the next problem is a real challenge
        the first time you try it. Try solving 89 × 72 in your head, looking

        <strong>The Subtraction Method</strong>

        The subtraction method really comes in handy when one of the numbers you
        want to multiply ends in 8 or 9. The following problem illustrates what
        I mean: <a id="page60"></a>

        + 153 = 1003.)

        Not only do I use the subtraction method with numbers that end in 8 or
        9, but also for numbers in the high 90s because 100 is such a convenient

        as you work your way through the problems below. For example, subtract
        340 − 78. We know the answer will be in the 200s. The difference between
        40 and 78 is 38. Now take the complement of 38 to get 62. And that’s the

        Again, you can see that the answer will be 3900 and something. Because

        As you may have realized, you can use this method with any subtraction
        problem that requires you to borrow a number, not just those that are

      <p className="indent">
        To factor a number means to break it down into one-digit numbers that,
        when multiplied together, give the original number. For example, the
        number 24 can be factored into 8 × 3 or 6 × 4. (It can also be factored
        into 12 × 2, but we prefer to use only single-digit factors.)
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Here are some other examples of factored numbers:
      </p>
      <p className="nonindentt">
        <strong>42 = 7 × 6</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>63 = 9 × 7</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>84 = 7×6×2 or 7×4×3</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page64"></a>To see how factoring makes multiplication easier,
        consider the following problem:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="45"
          src="/Static/images/Benj_9780307347466_epub_127_r1.jpg"
          width="119"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Previously we solved this problem by multiplying 46 × 40 and 46 × 2 and
        adding the products together. To use the factoring method, treat 42 as 7
        × 6 and begin by multiplying 46 × 7, which is 322. Then multiply 322 × 6
        for the final answer of 1932. You already know how to do 2-by-1 and
        3-by-1 multiplication problems, so this should not be too hard:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>46 × 42 = 46 × (7 × 6) = (46 × 7) × 6 = 322 × 6 = 1932</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Of course, this problem could also have been solved by reversing the
        factors of 42:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>46 × 42 = 46 × (6 × 7) = (46 × 6) × 7 = 276 × 7 = 1932</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        In this case, it is easier to multiply 322 × 6 than it is to multiply
        276 × 7. In most cases, I like to use the larger factor in solving the
        initial 2-by-1 problem and to reserve the smaller factor for the 3-by-1
        component of the problem.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Factoring results in a 2-by-2 multiplication problem being simplified to
        an easier 3-by-1 (or sometimes 2-by-1) multiplication problem. The
        advantage of the factoring method in mental calculation is you do not
        have to hold much in memory. Let’s look at another example, 75 × 63:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>75 × 63 = 75 × (9 × 7) = (75 × 9) × 7 = 675 × 7 = 4725</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page65"></a>As before, you simplify this 2-by-2 problem by
        factoring 63 into 9 × 7 and then multiplying 75 by these factors. (By
        the way, the reason we can shift parentheses in the second step is the{" "}
        <em>associative law</em> of multiplication.)
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>
          63 × 75 = 63 × (5 × 5 × 3) = (63 × 5) × 5 × 3 = 315 × 5 × 3 = 1575 × 3
          = 4725
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">Try the following problem for practice:</p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>57 × 24 = 57 × 8 × 3 = 456 × 3 = 1368</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        You could have factored 24 as 6 × 4 for another easy computation:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>57 × 24 = 57 × 6 × 4 = 342 × 4 = 1368</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">Compare this approach with the addition method:</p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img

          width="526"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        With the addition method, you have to perform two 2-by-1 problems and
        then add. With the factoring method, you have just two multiplication
        problems: a 2-by-1 and a 3-by-1, and then you are done. The factoring
        method is usually easier on your memory.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page66"></a>Remember that challenging multiplication problem
        earlier in this chapter? Here it is again:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img

        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        We tackled that problem easily enough with the subtraction method, but
        factoring works even faster:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>89 × 72 = 89 × 9 × 8 = 801 × 8 = 6408</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        The problem is especially easy because of the 0 in the middle of 801.
        Our next example illustrates that it sometimes pays to factor the
        numbers in an order that exploits this situation. Let’s look at two ways
        of computing 67 × 42:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>67 × 42 = 67 × 7 × 6 = 469 × 6 = 2814</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>67 × 42 = 67 × 6 × 7 = 402 × 7 = 2814</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Ordinarily you should factor 42 into 7 × 6, as in the first example,
        following the rule of using the larger factor first. But the problem is
        easier to solve if you factor 42 into 6 × 7 because it creates a number
        with a 0 in the center, which is easier to multiply. I call such numbers{" "}
        <em>friendly products</em>.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Look for the friendly product in the problem done two ways below:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>43 × 56 = 43 × 8 × 7 = 344 × 7 = 2408</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>43 × 56 = 43 × 7 × 8 = 301 × 8 = 2408</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">Did you think the second way was easier?</p>
      <p className="indent">
        When using the factoring method, it pays to find friendly{" "}
        <a id="page67"></a>products whenever you can. The following list should
        help. I don’t expect you to memorize it so much as to familiarize
        yourself with it. With practice you will be able to nose out friendly
        products more often, and the list will become more meaningful.

        a single problem, 73 × 49. We’ll begin by using the addition method:

      <p className="nonindent">
        Squaring three-digit numbers is an impressive feat of mental
        prestidigitation. Just as you square two-digit numbers by rounding up or
        down to the nearest multiple of 10, to square three-digit numbers, you
        round up or down to the nearest multiple of 100. Take 193:

        By rounding up to 200 and down to 186, you’ve transformed a 3-by-3
        multiplication problem into a far simpler 3-by-1 problem. After all, 200
        × 186 is just 2 × 186 = 372 with two zeros attached. Almost done! Now
        all you have to add is 7<sup className="frac">2</sup> = 49 to arrive at
        37,249.

        The first problem is deciding what numbers to multiply together. Clearly
        one of the numbers will be 900, and the other number will be in the
        800s. But what number? You can compute it two ways:
      </p>
      <div className="hangings">
        <p className="hanging">
          1. The hard way: the difference between 863 and 900 is 37 (the
          complement of 63). Subtract 37 from 863 to arrive at 826.{" "}
          <a id="page74"></a>
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">
          2. The easy way: double the number 63 to get 126, and take the last
          two digits to give you 826.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Here’s why the easy way works. Because both numbers are the same
        distance from 863, their sum must be twice 863, or 1726. One of your
        numbers is 900, so the other must be 826.

        </p>
        <p className="textbox">
          <span className="dropcaps">T</span>he mathematical chestnut of 1991
          that got everyone hopping mad was an article in <em>Parade</em>{" "}
          magazine by Marilyn vos Savant, the woman listed by the{" "}
          <em>Guinness Book of World Records</em> as having the world’s highest
          IQ. The paradox has come to be known as the Monty Hall problem, and it
          goes like this.
        </p>
        <p className="textbox1">
          You are a contestant on <em>Let’s Make a Deal</em>. Monty Hall allows
          you to pick one of three doors; behind one of these doors is the big
          prize, behind the other two are goats. You pick Door Number 2. But
          before Monty reveals the prize of your choice, he shows you what you
          didn’t pick behind Door Number 3. It’s a goat. Now, in his tantalizing
          way, Monty gives you another choice. Do you want to stick with Door
          Number 2, or do you want to risk a chance to see what’s behind Door
          Number 1? What should you do? Assuming that Monty is only going to
          reveal where the big prize is not, he will always open one of the
          consolation doors. This leaves two doors, one with the big prize and
          the other with another consolation. The odds are now 50–50 for your
          choice, right?
        </p>
        <p className="textbox1">
          Wrong! The odds that you chose correctly the first time remain 1 in 3.
          The probability that the big prize is behind the other door increases
          to 2 in 3 because the probability must add to 1.
        </p>
        <p className="textbox1">
          Thus, by switching doors, you double the odds of winning! (The problem
          assumes that Monty will always give a player the option to switch,
          that he will always reveal a nonwinning door, and that when your first
          pick is correct he will choose a nonwinning door at random.) Think of
          playing the game with ten doors and after your pick he reveals eight
          other nonwinning doors. Here, your instincts would probably tell you
          to switch. People confuse this problem for a variant: if Monty Hall
          does not know where the grand prize is, and reveals Door Number 3,
          which happens to contain a goat (though it might have contained the
          prize), then Door Number 1 has a 50 percent chance of being correct.
          This result is so counterintuitive that Marilyn vos Savant received
          piles of letters, many from scientists and even mathematicians,
          telling her she shouldn’t write about math. They were all wrong.{" "}

        <strong>CUBING</strong>

        We end this chapter with a new method for cubing two-digit numbers.
        (Recall that the cube of a number is that number multiplied by itself
        twice. For example, 5 cubed—denoted 5<sup className="frac">3</sup>

        not much harder than multiplying two-digit numbers. The method is based

        where <em>d</em> is any number. Just like with squaring two-digit
        numbers, I choose <em>d</em> to be the distance to the nearest multiple
        of ten. For example, when squaring 13, we let <em>d</em> = 3, resulting

        We can solve 48 × 49 by the factoring method, but for this sort of

        We note that when the close-together method is used for the

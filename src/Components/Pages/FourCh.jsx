        Mental Division

      <p className="nonindent">
        <span className="big">M</span>ental division is a particularly handy skill
        to have, both in business and in daily life. How many times a week are
        you confronted with situations that call on you to evenly divide things,
        such as a check at a restaurant? This same skill comes in handy when you
        want to figure out the cost per unit of a case of dog food on sale, or
        to split the pot in poker, or to figure out how many gallons of gas you
        can buy with a $20 bill. The ability to divide in your head can save you
        the inconvenience of having to pull out a calculator every time you need
        to compute something.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        With mental division, the left-to-right method of calculation comes into
        its own. This is the same method we all learned in school, so you will
        be doing what comes naturally. I remember as a kid thinking that this
        left-to-right method of division is the way all arithmetic should be
        done. I have often speculated that if the schools could have figured out
        a way to teach division right-to-left, they probably would have done so!

        <strong>ONE-DIGIT DIVISION</strong>
      </h2>
      <p className="nonindent">
        The first step when dividing mentally is to figure out how many digits
        will be in your answer. To see what I mean, try on the following problem
        for size:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>179 ÷ 7</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        To solve 179 ÷ 7, we’re looking for a number, <em>Q</em>, such that 7
        times <em>Q</em> is 179. Now, since 179 lies between 7 × 10 = 70 and 7 ×
        100 = 700, <em>Q</em> must lie between 10 and 100, which means our
        answer must be a two-digit number. Knowing that, we first determine the
        largest multiple of 10 that can be multiplied by 7 whose answer is below
        179. We know that 7 × 20 = 140 and 7 × 30 = 210, so our answer must be
        in the twenties. At this point we can actually <em>say</em> the number
        20 since that part of our answer will certainly not change. Next we
        subtract 179 − 140 = 39. Our problem has now been reduced to the
        division problem 39 ÷ 7. Since 7 × 5 = 35, which is 4 away from 39, we
        have the rest of our answer, namely 5 with a remainder of 4, or 5 and{" "}

          width="11"
        />
        . Altogether, we have our answer, 25 with a remainder of 4, or if you
        prefer, 25
        <img
          alt=""

        . Here’s what the process looks like:

      <div className="dis_img">

        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page82"></a>Let’s try a similar division problem using the same
        method of mental computation:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>675</strong> ÷ <strong>8</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        As before, since 675 falls between 8 × 10 = 80 and 8 × 100 = 800, your
        answer must be below 100 and therefore is a two-digit number. To divide
        8 into 675, notice that 8 × 80 = 640 and 8 × 90 = 720. Therefore, your
        answer is 80 something. But what is that “something”? To find out,
        subtract 640 from 675 for a remainder of 35. After saying the 80, our
        problem has been reduced to 35 ÷ 8. Since 8 × 4 = 32, the final answer
        is 84 with a remainder of 3, or 84⅜. We illustrate this problem as
        follows:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="218"

          width="371"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Like most mental calculations, division can be thought of as a process
        of simplification. The more you calculate, the simpler the problem
        becomes. What began as 675 ÷ 8 was simplified to a smaller problem, 35 ÷
        8.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Now let’s try a division problem that results in a three-digit answer:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>947</strong> ÷ <strong>4</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page83"></a>This time, your answer will have three digits because
        947 falls between 4 × 100 = 400 and 4 × 1000 = 4000. Thus we must first
        find the largest multiple of 100 that can be <em>squeezed</em> into 947.
        Since 4 × 200 = 800, our answer is definitely in the 200s, so go ahead
        and say it! Subtracting 800 from 947 gives us our new division problem,
        147 ÷ 4. Since 4 × 30 = 120, we can now say the 30. After subtracting
        120 from 147, we compute 27 ÷ 4 to obtain the rest of the answer: 6 with
        a remainder of 3. Altogether, we have 236 with a remainder of 3, or
        236¾.
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">

          width="220"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        The process is just as easy when dividing a one-digit number into a
        four-digit number, as in our next example.
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>2196</strong> ÷ <strong>5</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Here the answer will be in the hundreds because 2196 is between 5{" "}
        <strong>×</strong> 100 = 500 and 5 <strong>×</strong> 1000 = 5000. After
        subtracting 5 <strong>×</strong> 400 = 2000, we can say the 400, and our
        problem has reduced to 196 ÷ 5, which can be solved as in the previous
        examples. <a id="page84"></a>

      <div className="dis_img">

      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Actually, there is a much easier way to solve this last problem. We can
        simplify our problem by doubling both numbers. Since 2196 × 2 = 4392, we
        have 2196 ÷ 5 = 4392 ÷ 10 = 439.2 or{" "}

        <strong>THE RULE OF “THUMB”</strong>
      </h2>
      <p className="nonindent">
        When dividing in your head instead of on paper, you may find it
        difficult to remember parts of the answer as you continue to calculate.
        One option, as you’ve seen, is to say the answer out loud as you go. But
        for greater dramatic effect, you may prefer, as I do, to hold the answer
        on your fingers and say it all together at the end. In that case, you
        may run into problems remembering digits greater than five if, like most
        of us, you have only five fingers on each hand. The solution is to use a
        special technique, based on sign language, which I call the Rule of
        “Thumb.” It is most effective for remembering three-digit and greater
        numbers. <a id="page85"></a>This technique not only is useful in this
        chapter but also will come in handy (pardon the pun) in subsequent
        chapters dealing with larger problems and longer numbers to remember.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        You already know that to represent numbers 0 through 5, all you have to
        do is raise the equivalent number of fingers on your hand. When you get
        your thumb involved, it’s just as easy to represent numbers 6 through 9.
        Here are the Rules of “Thumb”:
      </p>
      <div className="block">
        <p className="bl_hanging">
          • To hold on to 6, place your thumb on top of your pinky.
        </p>
        <p className="bl_hanging">
          • To hold on to 7, place your thumb on top of your ring finger.
        </p>
        <p className="bl_hanging">
          • To hold on to 8, place your thumb on top of your middle finger.
        </p>
        <p className="bl_hanging">
          • To hold on to 9, place your thumb on top of your index finger.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        With three-digit answers, hold the hundreds digit on your left hand and
        the tens digit on your right. When you get to the ones digit, you’ve
        reached the end of the problem (except for a possible remainder). Now
        say the number on your left hand, the number on your right hand, the
        one-digit you’ve just computed, and the remainder (in your head).
        Presto—you’ve said your answer!
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        For practice, try to compute the following four-digit division problem:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="301"

          width="128"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page86"></a>In using the Rule of “Thumb” to remember the answer,
        you’ll hold the 7 on your left hand by placing your thumb and ring
        finger together and the 6 on your right hand by placing your thumb and
        little finger together. Once you’ve calculated the ones digit (which is
        3) and the remainder (which is 1), you can “read” the final answer off
        your hands from left to right: “seven&#160;…&#160;six&#160;…&#160;three
        with a remainder of one, or one-sixth.”
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Some four-digit division problems yield four-digit answers. In that
        case, since you have only two hands, you will have to say the thousands
        digit of the answer out loud and use the rule of thumb to remember the
        rest of the answer. For example:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>8352</strong> ÷ <strong>3</strong>
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">

          width="119"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        For this problem, you divide 3 into 8 to get your thousands digit of 2,
        say “two thousand” out loud, then divide 3 into 2352 in the usual way.

        <strong>TWO-DIGIT DIVISION</strong>
      </h2>
      <p className="nonindent">
        This section assumes you already have mastered the art of dividing by a
        one-digit number. Naturally, division problems become harder as the
        number you divide by gets larger. Fortunately, I have some magic up my
        sleeve to make your life easier.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">Let’s start with a relatively easy problem first:</p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>597</strong> ÷ <strong>14</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Since 597 lies between 14 × 10 and 14 × 100, the answer (also called the
        quotient) lies between 10 and 100. To determine the answer, your first
        step is to ask how many times 14 goes into 590. Because 14 × 40 = 560,
        you know that the answer is 40 something, and so you can say “forty” out
        loud.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Next, subtract 560 from 597, which is 37 and reduces your problem to
        dividing 14 into 37. Since 14 × 2 = 28, your answer is 42. Subtracting
        28 from 37 leaves you a remainder of 9. The process of deriving the
        solution to this problem may be illustrated as follows:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="216"

          width="128"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        The following problem is slightly harder because the two-digit divisor
        (here 23) is larger. <a id="page88"></a>
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>682</strong> ÷ <strong>23</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        In this problem, the answer is a two-digit number because 682 falls
        between 23 × 10 = 230 and 23 × 100 = 2300. To figure out the tens digit
        of the two-digit answer, you need to ask how many times 23 goes into
        680. If you try 30, you’ll see that it’s slightly too much, as 30 × 23 =
        690. Now you know that the answer is 20 something, and you can say so.
        Then subtract 23 × 20 = 460 from 682 to obtain 222. Since 23 × 9 = 207,
        the answer is 29 with a remainder of 222 − 207 = 15.

      <p className="indent">Now consider:</p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>491</strong> ÷ <strong>62</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Since 491 is less than 62 × 10 = 620, your answer will simply be a
        one-digit number with a remainder. You might guess 8, but 62 × 8 = 496,
        which is a little high. Since 62 × 7 = 434, the answer is 7 with a
        remainder of 491 − 434 = 57, or

      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Actually, there’s a nifty trick to make problems like this easier.
        Remember how you first tried multiplying 62 × 8, but found it came out a
        little high at 496? Well, that wasn’t a wasted effort. Aside from
        knowing that the answer is 7, you can also compute the remainder right
        away. Since 496 is 5 more than 491, the remainder will be 5 less than
        62, the divisor. Since 62 − 5 = 57, your answer is 7
        <img
          alt=""
          height="25"

          width="18"
        />
        . The reason this trick works is because 491 = (62 × 8) − 5 = 62 × (7 +
        1) − 5 = (62 × 7 + 62) − 5 = (62 × 7) + (62 − 5) = 62 × 7 + 57.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Now try 380 ÷ 39 using the shortcut we just learned. So 39{" "}
        <strong>×</strong> 10 = 390, which is too high by 10. Hence the answer
        is 9 with a remainder of 39 − 10 = 29.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Your next challenge is to divide a two-digit number into a four-digit
        number:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>3657</strong> ÷ <strong>54</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Since 54 × 100 = 5400, you know your answer will be a two-digit number.
        To arrive at the first digit of the answer, you need to figure how many
        times 54 goes into 3657. Since 54 × 70 = 3780 is a little high, you know
        the answer must be 60 something.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Next, multiply 54 × 60 = 3240 and subtract 3657 − 3240 = 417. Once you
        say the 60, your problem has been simplified to 417 ÷ 54. Since 54 × 8 =
        432 is a little too high, your last digit is 7 with the remainder 54 −
        15 = 39. <a id="page90"></a>

        <strong>Simplifying Division Problems</strong>
      </h3>
      <p className="nonindent">
        If by this point you’re suffering from brain strain, relax. As promised,
        I want to share with you a couple of tricks for simplifying certain
        mental division problems. These tricks are based on the principle of
        dividing both parts of the problem by a common factor. If both numbers
        in the problem are even numbers, you can make the problem twice as easy
        by dividing each number <a id="page91"></a>by 2 before you begin. For
        example, 858 ÷ 16 has two even numbers, and dividing each by 2 yields
        the much simpler problem of 429 ÷ 8:

          width="429"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        As you can see, the remainders 10 and 5 are not the same; but if you
        write the remainder in the form of a fraction, you get that{" "}
        <img

        />
        is the same as ⅝. Therefore, when using this method, you must always
        express the answer in fractional form.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        We’ve done both sets of calculations for you to see how much easier it
        is. Now you try one for practice:

      <div className="dis_img">

          width="375"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        The problem on the right is much easier to calculate mentally. If you’re
        really alert, you could divide both sides of the <a id="page92"></a>
        original problem by 18 to arrive at an even simpler problem: 201 ÷ 3 =
        67.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Watch for problems that can be divided by 2 twice, such as 1652 ÷ 36:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">

          width="511"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        I usually find it easier to divide the problem by 2 twice than to divide
        both numbers by 4. Next, when both numbers end in 0, you can divide each
        by 10:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">

          width="331"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        But if both numbers end in 5, double them and then divide both by 10 to
        simplify the problem. For example:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""

      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Finally, if the divisor ends in 5 and the number you’re dividing into
        ends in 0, multiply both by 2 and then divide by 10, just as you did
        above:

          <strong>TESTING FOR DIVISIBILITY</strong>
        </h2>
        <p className="nonindent">
          In the last section, we saw how division problems could be simplified
          when both numbers were divisible by a common factor. We end this
          chapter with a brief discussion of how to determine whether one number
          is a factor of another number. Being able to find the factors of a
          number helps us simplify division problems and can speed up many
          multiplication problems. This will also be a very useful tool when we
          get to advanced multiplication, as you will often be looking for ways
          to factor a two-, <a id="page99"></a>three-, or even a five-digit
          number in the middle of a multiplication problem. Being able to factor
          these numbers quickly is very handy. And besides, I think some of the
          rules are just beautiful.
        </p>
        <p className="indent">
          It’s easy to test whether a number is divisible by 2. All you need to
          do is to check if the last digit is even. If the last digit is 2, 4,
          6, 8, or 0, the entire number is divisible by 2.
        </p>
        <p className="indent">
          To test whether a number is divisible by 4, check if the two-digit
          number at the end is divisible by 4. The number 57,852 is a multiple
          of 4 because 52 = 13 <strong>×</strong> 4. The number 69,346 is not a
          multiple of 4 because 46 is not a multiple of 4. The reason this works
          is because 4 divides evenly into 100 and thus into any multiple of
          100. Thus, since 4 divides evenly into 57,800, and 4 divides into 52,
          we know that 4 divides evenly into their sum, 57,852.
        </p>
        <p className="indent">
          Likewise, since 8 divides into 1000, to test for divisibility by 8,
          check the last three digits of the number. For the number 14,918,
          divide 8 into 918. Since this leaves you with a remainder (918 ÷ 8 =
          114
          <img
            alt=""
            height="25"
            src="/images/Benj_9780307347466_epub_494_r1.jpg"
            width="10"
          />
          ), the number is not divisible by 8. You could also have observed this
          by noticing that 18 (the last two digits of 14,918) is not divisible
          by 4, and since 14,918 is not divisible by 4, it can’t be divisible by
          8 either.
        </p>
        <p className="indent">
          When it comes to divisibility by 3, here’s a cool rule that’s easy to
          remember: A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its
          digits are divisible by 3—no matter how many digits are in the number.
          To test whether 57,852 is divisible by 3, simply add 5 + 7 + 8 + 5 + 2
          = 27. Since 27 is a multiple of 3, we know 57,852 is a multiple of 3.
          The same amazing rule holds true for divisibility by 9. A number is
          divisible by 9 if and only if its digits sum to a multiple of 9.
          Hence, 57,852 is a multiple of 9, whereas 31,416, which sums to 15, is
          not. The reason this works is based on the fact that the numbers 1,
          10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, and so on, are all 1 greater than a multiple
          of 9.
        </p>
        <p className="indent">
          <a id="page100"></a>A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is
          even and divisible by 3, so it is easy to test divisibility by 6.
        </p>
        <p className="indent">
          To establish whether a number is divisible by 5 is even easier. Any
          number, no matter how large, is a multiple of 5 if and only if it ends
          in 5 or 0.
        </p>
        <p className="indent">
          Establishing divisibility by 11 is almost as easy as determining
          divisibility by 3 or 9. A number is divisible by 11 if and only if you
          arrive at either 0 or a multiple of 11 when you alternately subtract
          and add the digits of a number. For instance, 73,958 is not divisible
          by 11 since 7−3 + 9 − 5 + 8 = 16. However, the numbers 8,492 and
          73,194 are multiples of 11, since 8 − 4 + 9 − 2 = 11 and 7 − 3 + 1 − 9
          + 4 = 0. The reason this works is based, like the rule for 3s and 9s,
          on the fact that the numbers 1, 100, 10,000, and 1,000,000 are 1 more
          than a multiple of 11, whereas the numbers 10, 1,000, 100,000, and so
          on are 1 less than a multiple of 11.
        </p>
        <p className="indent">
          Testing for divisibility by 7 is a bit trickier. If you add or
          subtract a number that is a multiple of 7 to the number you are
          testing, and the resulting number is a multiple of 7, then the test is
          positive. I always choose to add or subtract a multiple of 7 so that
          the resulting sum or difference ends in 0. For example, to test the
          number 5292, I subtract 42 (a multiple of 7) to obtain 5250. Next, I
          get rid of the 0 at the end (since dividing by ten does not affect
          divisibility by seven), leaving me with 525. Then I repeat the process
          by adding 35 (a multiple of 7), which gives me 560. When I delete the
          0, I’m left with 56, which I know to be a multiple of 7. Therefore,
          the original number 5292 is divisible by 7.
        </p>
        <p className="indent">
          This method works not only for 7s, but also for any odd number that
          doesn’t end in 5. For example, to test whether 8792 is divisible by
          13, subtract 4 × 13 = 52 from 8792, to <a id="page101"></a>arrive at
          8740. Dropping the 0 results in 874. Then add 2 × 13 = 26 to arrive at
          900. Dropping the two 0s leaves you with 9, which is clearly not a
          multiple of 13. Therefore, 8792 is not a multiple of 13.

        <span className="big">I</span> probably spent too much time of my
        childhood thinking about faster and faster ways to perform mental
        multiplication; I was diagnosed as hyperactive and my parents were told
        that I had a short attention span and probably would not be successful
        in school. (Fortunately, my parents ignored that advice. I was also
        lucky to have some incredibly patient teachers in my first few years of
        school.) It might have been my short attention span that motivated me to
        develop quick ways to do arithmetic. I don’t think I had the patience to
        carry out math problems with pencil and paper. Once you have mastered
        the techniques described in this chapter, you won’t want to rely on
        pencil and paper again, either.

      <p className="indent">
        In this chapter you will learn how to multiply in your head one-digit
        numbers by two-digit numbers and three-digit numbers. You will also
        learn a phenomenally fast way to square two-digit numbers. Even friends
        with calculators won’t be able to keep up with you. Believe me,
        virtually everyone will be dumbfounded by the fact that such problems
        can not only be done <a id="page30"></a>mentally, but can be computed so
        quickly. I sometimes wonder whether we were not cheated in school; these
        methods are so simple once you learn them.

      <p className="indent">
        There is one small prerequisite for mastering the skills in this
        chapter—you need to know the multiplication tables through ten. In fact,
        to really make headway, you need to know your multiplication tables
        backward and forward. For those of you who need to shake the cobwebs
        loose, consult the multiplication chart below. Once you’ve got your
        tables down, you are ready to begin.

        , you got into the habit of adding and subtracting from left to right.
        You will do virtually all the calculations in this chapter from left to
        right as well. This is undoubtedly the opposite of what you learned in
        school.
        <a id="page31"></a>But you’ll soon see how much easier it is to think
        from left to right than from right to left. (For one thing, you can
        start to say your answer aloud before you have finished the calculation.
        That way you seem to be calculating even faster than you are!)
      </p>
      <p className="indent">Let’s tackle our first problem:</p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img

          width="37"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        First, multiply 40 × 7 = 280. (Note that 40 × 7 is just like 4 × 7, with
        a friendly zero attached.) Next, multiply 2 × 7= 14. Then add 280 plus
        14 (left to right, of course) to arrive at 294, the correct answer. We
        illustrate this procedure below.
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">

          width="213"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        We have omitted diagramming the mental addition of 280 + 14, since you
        learned how to do that computation in the last chapter. At first you
        will need to look down at the problem while doing the calculation. With
        practice you will be able to forgo this step and compute the whole thing
        in your mind.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">Let’s try another example:</p>

        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Your first step is to break down the problem into small multiplication
        tasks that you can perform mentally with ease. Since <a id="page32"></a>
        48 = 40 + 8, multiply 40 × 4 = 160, then add 8 × 4 = 32. The answer is
        192. (Note: If you are wondering <em>why</em> this process works, see
        the Why These Tricks Work section at the end of the chapter.)

      <p className="indent">
        Here are two more mental multiplication problems that you should be able
        to solve fairly quickly. First calculate 62 × 3. Then do 71 × 9. Try
        doing them in your head before looking at how we did it.

        These two examples are especially simple because the numbers being added
        essentially do not overlap at all. When doing 180 + 6, you can
        practically
        <em>hear</em> the answer:
        <em>One hundred eighty&#160;…&#160;six!</em> Another especially easy
        type of mental multiplication problem involves numbers that begin with
        five. When the five is multiplied by an even digit, the first product
        will be a multiple of 100, which makes the resulting addition problem a
        snap.

        Notice how much easier this problem is to do from left to right. It
        takes far less time to calculate “400 plus 35” mentally than it does to
        apply the pencil-and-paper method of “putting down the 5 and carrying
        the 3.”

      <p className="indent">The following two problems are a little harder.</p>

        As usual, we break these problems down into easier problems. For the one
        on the left, multiply 30 × 9 plus 8 × 9, giving you 270 + 72. The
        addition problem is slightly harder because it involves carrying a
        number. Here 270 + 70 + 2 = 340 + 2 = 342.

      <p className="indent">
        With practice, you will become more adept at juggling
        <a id="page34"></a>problems like these in your head, and those that
        require you to carry numbers will be almost as easy as those that don’t.

        <strong>Rounding Up</strong>
      </h3>
      <p className="nonindent">
        You saw in the last chapter how useful rounding up can be when it comes
        to subtraction. The same goes for multiplication, especially when you
        are multiplying numbers that end in eight or nine.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Let’s take the problem of 69 × 6, illustrated below. On the left we have
        calculated it the usual way, by adding 360 + 54. On the right, however,
        we have rounded 69 up to 70, and subtracted 420 − 6, which you might
        find easier to do.

      <div className="dis_img">

        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        The following example also shows how much easier rounding up can be:

      <p className="indent">
        The subtraction method works especially well for numbers that are just
        one or two digits away from a multiple of 10. It does not work so well
        when you need to round up more than two digits <a id="page35"></a>
        because the subtraction portion of the problem gets difficult. As it is,
        you may prefer to stick with the addition method. Personally, for
        problems of this size, I use only the addition method because in the
        time spent deciding which method to use, I could have already done the
        calculation!

      <p className="indent">
        So that you can perfect your technique, I strongly recommend practicing
        more 2-by-1 multiplication problems. Below are twenty problems for you
        to tackle. I have supplied you with the answers in the back, including a
        breakdown of each component of the multiplication. If, after you’ve
        worked out these problems, you would like to practice more, make up your
        own. Calculate mentally, then check your answer with a calculator. Once
        you feel confident that you can perform these problems rapidly in your
        head, you are ready to move to the next level of mental calculation.

        <strong>3-BY-1 MULTIPLICATION PROBLEMS</strong>
      </h2>
      <p className="nonindent">
        Now that you know how to do 2-by-1 multiplication problems in your head,
        you will find that multiplying three digits by a single digit is not
        much more difficult. You can get started with the following 3-by-1
        problem (which is really just a 2-by-1 problem in disguise):
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img
          alt=""
          height="124"

          width="253"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Was that easy for you? (If this problem gave you trouble, you might want
        to review the addition material in
        <a className="hlink" href="Benj_9780307347466_epub_c01_r1.htm">
          Chapter 1
        </a>
        .) Let’s try another 3-by-1 problem similar to the one you just did,
        except we have replaced the 0 with a 6 so you have another step to
        perform:
      </p>
      <div className="dis_img">
        <img

          width="293"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        In this case, you simply add the product of 6 × 7, which you already
        know to be 42, to the first sum of 2240. Since you do not need to carry
        any numbers, it is easy to add 42 to 2240 to arrive at the total of
        2282.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        In solving this and other 3-by-1 multiplication problems, the difficult
        part may be holding in memory the first sum (in this case, 2240) while
        doing the next multiplication problem (in this <a id="page37"></a>case,
        6 × 7). There is no magic secret to remembering that first number, but
        with practice I guarantee you will improve your concentration, and
        holding on to numbers while performing other functions will get easier.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">Let’s try another problem:</p>
      <div className="dis_img">

          width="294"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Even if the numbers are large, the process is just as simple. For
        example:

        When first solving these problems, you may have to glance down at the
        page as you go along to remind yourself what the original problem is.
        This is okay at first. But try to break the habit so that eventually you
        are holding the problem entirely in memory.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        In the last section on 2-by-1 multiplication problems, we saw that
        problems involving numbers that begin with five are
        <a id="page38"></a>sometimes especially easy to solve. The same is true
        for 3-by-1 problems:

      <div className="dis_img">

      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Notice that whenever the first product is a multiple of 1000, the
        resulting addition problem is no problem at all. This is because you do
        not have to carry any numbers and the thousands digit does not change.
        If you were solving the problem above in front of someone else, you
        would be able to say your first product—“three thousand&#160;…”—out loud
        with complete confidence that a carried number would not change it to
        4000. (As an added bonus, by quickly saying the first digit, it gives
        the illusion that you computed the entire answer immediately!) Even if
        you are practicing alone, saying your first product out loud frees up
        some memory space while you work on the remaining 2-by-1 problem, which
        you can say out loud as well—in this case, “…&#160;three hundred
        seventy-eight.”
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Try the same approach in solving the next problem, where the multiplier
        is a 5:

      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page39"></a>Because the first two digits of the three-digit
        number are even, you can say the answer as you calculate it without
        having to add anything! Don’t you wish all multiplication problems were
        this easy?

        Let’s escalate the challenge by trying a couple of problems that require

        The first part of each of these problems is easy enough to compute
        mentally. The difficult part comes in holding the preliminary answer in
        your head while computing the final answer. In the case of the first
        problem, it is easy to add 5400 + 360 = 5760, but you may have to repeat
        5760 to yourself several times while you multiply 8 × 9 = 72. Then add
        5760 + 72. Sometimes at this stage I will start to say my answer aloud
        before finishing. Because I know I will have to carry when I add 60 +
        72, I know that 5700 will become 5800, so I say “fifty-eight hundred
        and&#160;…” Then I pause to compute 60 + 72 = 132. Because I have
        already carried, I say only the last two digits, “…&#160;thirty-two!”
        And there is the answer: 5832.

        The next two problems require you to carry two numbers each, so they may

        When you are first tackling these problems, repeat the answers to each
        part out loud as you compute the rest. In the first problem, for
        example, start by saying, “Twenty-eight hundred plus five hundred sixty”
        a couple of times out loud to reinforce the two numbers in memory while
        you add them together. Repeat the answer—“thirty-three hundred
        sixty”—several times while you multiply 9 × 7= 63. Then repeat
        “thirty-three hundred sixty plus sixty-three” aloud until you compute
        the final answer of 3423. If you are thinking fast enough to recognize
        that adding 60 + 63 will require you to carry a 1, you can begin to give
        the final answer a split second before you know it—“thirty-four hundred

          BE THERE OR B<sup className="frac">2</sup>: SQUARING TWO-DIGIT NUMBERS
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p className="nonindent">
        Squaring numbers in your head (multiplying a number by itself) is one of
        the easiest yet most impressive feats of mental calculation you can do.
        I can still recall where I was when I discovered how to do it. I was
        thirteen, sitting on a bus on the way to visit my father at work in
        downtown Cleveland. It was a trip I made often, so my mind began to
        wander. I’m not sure why, but I began thinking about the numbers that
        add up to 20, and I wondered, how large could the product of two such
        numbers get?
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        I started in the middle with 10 × 10 (or 10<sup className="frac">2</sup>
        ), the product of which is 100. Next, I multiplied 9 × 11 = 99, 8 × 12 =
        96, 7 × 13 = 91, 6 × 14 = 84, 5 × 15 = 75, 4 × 16 = 64, and so on. I
        noticed that the products were getting smaller, and their difference
        from 100 was 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36,&#160;…&#160;– or 1
        <sup className="frac">2</sup>, 2<sup className="frac">2</sup>, 3
        <sup className="frac">2</sup>, 4<sup className="frac">2</sup>, 5
        <sup className="frac">2</sup>, 6<sup className="frac">2</sup>
        ,&#160;…&#160;(see table below).

          width="476"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        I found this pattern astonishing. Next I tried numbers that add to 26
        and got similar results. First I worked out 13
        <sup className="frac">2</sup> = 169, then computed 12 × 14 = 168, 11 ×
        15 = 165, 10 × 16 = 160,
        <a id="page45"></a>9 × 17 = 153, and so on. Just as before, the
        distances these products were from 169 was 1
        <sup className="frac">2</sup>, 2<sup className="frac">2</sup>, 3
        <sup className="frac">2</sup>, 4<sup className="frac">2</sup>, and so on

      <p className="indent">
        There is actually a simple algebraic explanation for this phenomenon
        (see Why These Tricks Work,{" "}
        <a className="hlink" href="#page50">
          this page

        ). At the time, I didn’t know my algebra well enough to prove that this
        pattern would always occur, but I experimented with enough examples to
        become convinced of it.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Then I realized that this pattern could help me square numbers more
        easily. Suppose I wanted to square the number 13. Instead of multiplying
        13 <strong>×</strong> 13,

      <p className="nonindent">
        why not get an approximate answer by using two numbers that are easier
        to multiply but also add to 26? I chose 10 × 16 = 160. To get the final
        answer, I just added 3<sup className="frac">2</sup> = 9 (since 10 and 16
        are each 3 away from 13). Thus, 13<sup className="frac">2</sup> = 160 +
        9 = 169. Neat!

        Now let’s see how this works for another square: <a id="page46"></a>

        To square 41, subtract 1 to obtain 40 and add 1 to obtain 42. Next
        multiply 40 × 42. Don’t panic! This is simply a 2-by-1 multiplication
        problem (specifically, 4 × 42) in disguise. Since 4 × 42 = 168, 40 × 42
        = 1680. Almost done! All you have to add is the square of 1 (the number
        by which you went up and down from 41), giving you 1680 + 1 = 1681.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Can squaring a two-digit number be this easy? Yes, with this method and
        a little practice, it can. And it works whether you initially round down
        or round up. For example, let’s examine 77<sup className="frac">2</sup>,
        working it out both by rounding up and by rounding down:

      <div className="dis_img">

      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        In this instance the advantage of rounding up is that you are virtually
        done as soon as you have completed the multiplication problem because it
        is simple to add 9 to a number ending in 0!
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        In fact, for all two-digit squares, I always round up or down to the
        nearest multiple of 10. So if the number to be squared ends in 6, 7, 8,
        or 9, round up, and if the number to be squared ends in 1, 2, 3, or 4,
        round down. (If the number ends in 5, you <a id="page47"></a>do both!)
        With this strategy you will add only the numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, or 25 to
        your first calculation.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Let’s try another problem. Calculate 56<sup className="frac">2</sup> in
        your head before looking at how we did it, below:

          width="325"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Squaring numbers that end in 5 is even easier. Since you will always
        round up and down by 5, the numbers to be multiplied will both be
        multiples of 10. Hence, the multiplication and the addition are
        especially simple. We have worked out 85<sup className="frac">2</sup>{" "}
        and 35
        <sup className="frac">2</sup>, below:

          Chapter 0
        </a>
        , when you are squaring a number that ends in 5, rounding up and down
        allows you to blurt out the first part of the answer immediately and
        then finish it with 25. For example, if you want to compute 75
        <sup className="frac">2</sup>, rounding up to 80 and down to 70 will
        give you “Fifty-six hundred and&#160;…&#160;twenty-five!”
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        For numbers ending in 5, you should have no trouble beating someone with
        a calculator, and with a little practice with the <a id="page48"></a>
        other squares, it won’t be long before you can beat the calculator with
        any two-digit square number. Even large numbers are not to be feared.
        You can ask someone to give you a really big two-digit number, something
        in the high 90s, and it will sound as though you’ve chosen an impossible
        problem to compute. But, in fact, these are even easier because they
        allow you to round up to 100.

          <strong>Zerah Colburn: Entertaining Calculations</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="textbox">
          <span className="dropcaps">O</span>ne of the first lightning
          calculators to capitalize on his talent was Zerah Colburn (1804–1839),
          an American farmer’s son from Vermont who learned the multiplication
          tables to 100 before he could even read or write. By the age of six,
          young Zerah’s father took him on the road, where his performances
          generated enough capital to send him to school in Paris and London. By
          age eight he was internationally famous, performing lightning
          calculations in England, and was described in the{" "}
          <em>Annual Register</em> as “the most singular phenomenon in the
          history of the human mind that perhaps ever existed.” No less than
          Michael Faraday and Samuel Morse admired him.
        </p>
        <p className="textbox1">
          No matter where he went, Colburn met all challengers with speed and
          precision. He tells us in his autobiography of one set of problems he
          was given in New Hampshire in June 1811: “How many days and hours
          since the Christian Era commenced, 1811 years ago? Answered in twenty
          seconds: 661,015 days, 15,864,360 hours. How many seconds in eleven
          years? Answered in four seconds; 346,896,000.” Colburn used the same
          techniques described in this book to compute entirely in his head
          problems given to him. For example, he would factor large numbers into
          smaller numbers and then multiply: Colburn once multiplied 21,734 ×
          543 by factoring 543 into 181 × 3. He then multiplied 21,734 × 181 to
          arrive at 3,933,854, and finally multiplied that figure by 3, for a
          total of 11,801,562.
        </p>
        <p className="textbox1">
          As is often the case with lightning calculators, interest in Colburn’s
          amazing skills diminished with time, and by the age of twenty he had
          returned to America and become a Methodist preacher. He died at a
          youthful thirty-five. In summarizing his skills as a lightning
          calculator, and the advantage such an ability affords, Colburn
          reflected, “True, the method&#160;…&#160;requires a much larger number
          of figures than the common Rule, but it will be remembered that pen,
          ink and paper cost Zerah very little when engaged in a sum.”

        <strong>WHY THESE TRICKS WORK</strong>
      </h2>
      <p className="nonindent">
        This section is presented for teachers, students, math buffs, and anyone
        curious as to why our methods work. Some people may find the theory as
        interesting as the application. Fortunately, you need not understand why
        our methods work in order to understand how to apply them. All magic
        tricks have a rational explanation behind them, and mathemagical tricks
        are no different. It is here that the mathemagician reveals his deepest
        secrets!
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        In this chapter on multiplication problems, the distributive law is what
        allows us to break down problems into their component parts. The
        distributive law states that for any numbers <em>a, b</em>, and
        <em>c:</em>
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>
          <em>(b + c) × a = (b × a) + (c × a)</em>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        That is, the outside term, <em>a</em>, is distributed, or separately
        applied, to each of the inside terms, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>. For
        example, in our first mental multiplication problem of 42 × 7, we
        arrived at the answer by treating 42 as 40 + 2, then distributing the 7
        as follows:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>
          42 × 7 = (40 + 2) × 7 = (40 × 7) + (2 × 7) = 280 + 14 = 294
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        You may wonder why the distributive law works in the first place. To
        understand it intuitively, imagine having 7 bags, each containing 42
        coins, 40 of which are gold and 2 of which are silver. How many coins do
        you have altogether? There are two ways to arrive at the answer. In the
        first place, by the very definition of multiplication, there are 42 × 7
        coins. On the other hand, there are 40 × 7 gold coins and 2 × 7 silver
        coins. Hence, <a id="page51"></a>we have (40 × 7) + (2 × 7) coins
        altogether. By answering our question two ways, we have 42 × 7 = (40 ×
        7) + (2 × 7). Notice that the numbers 7, 40, and 2 could be replaced by
        any numbers (<em>a, b</em>, or <em>c</em>) and the same logic would
        apply. That’s why the distributive law works!

        Using similar reasoning with gold, silver, and copper coins we can
        derive:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>
          <em>(b + c + d) × a = (b × a) + (c × a) + (d × a)</em>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Hence, to do the problem 326 × 7, we break up 326 as 300 + 20 + 6, then
        distribute the 7, as follows: 326 × 7 = (300 + 20 + 6) × 7 = (300 × 7) +
        (20 × 7) + (6 × 7), which we then add up to get our answer.

        As for squaring, the following algebra justifies my method. For any
        numbers <em>A</em> and <em>d</em>

        Here, <em>A</em> is the number being squared; <em>d</em> can be any
        number, but I choose it to be the distance from <em>A</em> to the
        nearest multiple of 10. Hence, for 77<sup className="frac">2</sup>, I
        set <em>d</em> = 3 and our formula tells us that 77
        <sup className="frac">2</sup> = (77 + 3) × (77 − 3) + 3
        <sup className="frac">2</sup> = (80 × 74) + 9 = 5929. The following
        algebraic relationship also works to explain my squaring method:

      <p className="center">
        <strong>
          <em>

      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Hence, to square 41, we set z <em>=</em> 40 and <em>d =</em> 1 to get:

          41<sup className="frac">2</sup> = (40 + 1)

        laying with numbers has brought me great joy in life. I find that
        arithmetic can be just as entertaining as magic. But understanding the
        magical secrets of arithmetic requires algebra. Of course, there are
        other reasons to learn algebra (SATs, modeling real-world problems,
        computer programming, and understanding higher mathematics, to name just
        a few), but what first got me interested in algebra was the desire to
        understand some mathematical magic tricks, which I now present to you!

        <strong>PSYCHIC MATH</strong>

      <p className="nonindent">
        Say to a volunteer in the audience, “Think of a number, any number.” And
        you should also say, “But to make it easy on yourself, think of a
        one-digit or two-digit number.” After you’ve reminded your volunteer
        that there’s no way you could know her number, ask her to:
      </p>
      <div className="block1">
        <p className="hanging">1. double the number,</p>
        <p className="hanging">
          2. add 12, <a id="page200"></a>
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">3. divide the total by 2,</p>
        <p className="hanging">4. subtract the original number.</p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Then say, “Are you now thinking of the number six?” Try this one on
        yourself first and you will see that the sequence always produces the
        number 6 no matter what number is originally selected.
      </p>
      <h3 className="section">
        <strong>Why This Trick Works</strong>
      </h3>
      <p className="nonindent">
        This trick is based on simple algebra. In fact, I sometimes use this as
        a way to introduce algebra to students. The secret number that your
        volunteer chose can be represented by the letter <em>x</em>. Here are
        the functions you performed in the order you performed them:
      </p>
      <div className="block1">
        <p className="hanging">
          1. 2<em>x</em> (double the number)
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">
          2. 2<em>x</em> + 12 (then add 12)
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">
          3. (2<em>x</em> + 12) ÷ 2 = <em>× +</em> 6 (then divide by 2)
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">
          4. <em>x</em> + 6 – <em>x</em> = 6 (then subtract original number)
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        So no matter what number your volunteer chooses, the final answer will
        always be 6. If you repeat this trick, have the volunteer add a
        different number at step 2 (say 18). The final answer will be half that
        number (namely 9).

      </p>
      <div className="block1">
        <p className="hanging">
          1. secretly write down a three-digit number where the digits are

      <p className="nonindent">
        No matter what three-digit number you or anyone else chooses in this
        game, the final result will always be 1089. Why? Let <em>abc</em> denote
        the unknown three-digit number. Algebraically, this is equal to:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>100a + 10b + c</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        When you reverse the number and subtract it from the original number,
        you get the number <em>cba</em>, algebraically equal to:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>100c + 10b + a</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">

      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page202"></a>Hence, after subtracting in step 2, we must have one

        891, each one of which will produce 1089 after adding it to the reverse

      <h2 className="section">
        <strong>MISSING-DIGIT TRICKS</strong>
      </h2>
      <p className="nonindent">
        Using the number 1,089 from the last effect, hand a volunteer a
        calculator and ask her to multiply 1089 by any three-digit number she
        likes, but not to tell you the three-digit number. (Say she secretly
        multiplies 1,089 × 256 = 278,784.) Ask her how many digits are in her
        answer. She’ll reply, “Six.”
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Next you say: “Call out five of your six digits to me in any order you
        like. I shall try to determine the missing digit.”
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Suppose she calls out,
        “Two&#160;…&#160;four&#160;…&#160;seven&#160;…&#160;eight&#160;…&#160;eight.”
        You correctly tell her that she left out the number 7.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        The secret is based on the fact that a number is a multiple of 9 if and
        only if its digits sum to a multiple of 9. Since 1 + 0 + 8 + 9 = 18 is a
        multiple of 9, then so is 1089. Thus 1089 times any whole number will
        also be a multiple of 9. Since the digits called out add up to 29, and
        the next multiple of 9 greater than 29 is 36, our volunteer must have
        left out the number 7 (since 29 + 7= 36).
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        There are more subtle ways to force the volunteer to end up with a
        multiple of 9. Here are some of my favorites:
      </p>
      <div className="block1">
        <p className="hanging">
          1. Have the volunteer randomly choose a six-digit number, scramble its
          digits, then subtract the smaller six-digit number from the larger
          one. Since we’re subtracting two numbers with the same mod sum
          (indeed, the identical sum of digits), the resulting difference will
          have a mod sum of 0, and hence be a multiple of 9. Then continue as
          before to find the missing digit. <a id="page203"></a>
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">
          2. Have the volunteer secretly choose a four-digit number, reverse the
          digits, then subtract the smaller number from the larger. (This will
          be a multiple of 9.) Then multiply this by any three-digit number, and
          continue as before.
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">
          3. Ask the volunteer to multiply one-digit numbers randomly until the
          product is seven digits long. This is not “guaranteed” to produce a
          multiple of 9, but in practice it will do so at least 90% of the time
          (the chances are high that the one-digit numbers being multiplied
          include a 9 or two 3s or two 6s, or a 3 and a 6). I often use this
          method in front of mathematically advanced audiences who might see
          through other methods.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        There is one problem to watch out for. Suppose the numbers called out
        add up to a multiple of 9 (say 18). Then you have no way of determining
        whether the missing digit is 0 or 9. How do you remedy that? Simple—you
        cheat! You merely say, “You didn’t leave out a zero, did you?” If she
        did leave out a 0, you have completed the trick successfully. If she did
        not leave out the 0, you say: “Oh, it seemed as though you were thinking
        of nothing! You didn’t leave out a one, two, three, or four, did you?”
        She’ll either shake her head, or say no. Then you follow with, “Nor did
        you leave out a five, six, seven, or eight, either. You left out the
        number nine, didn’t you?” She’ll respond in the affirmative, and you
        will receive your well-deserved applause!

        <strong>LEAPFROG ADDITION</strong>
      </h2>
      <p className="nonindent">
        This trick combines a quick mental calculation with an astonishing
        prediction. Handing the spectator a card with ten lines, numbered 1
        through 10, have the spectator think of two positive numbers between 1
        and 20, and enter them on lines 1 and 2 of the card. Next have the
        spectator write the sum of lines 1 and <a id="page204"></a>2 on line 3,
        then the sum of lines 2 and 3 on line 4, and so on as illustrated below.

      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Finally, have the spectator show you the card. At a glance, you can tell
        him the sum of all the numbers on the card. For instance, in our
        example, you could instantly announce that the numbers sum up to 671
        faster than the spectator could do using a calculator! As a kicker, hand
        the spectator a calculator, and ask him to divide the number on line 10
        by the number on line 9. In our example, the quotient{" "}

        = 1.616.… Have the spectator announce the first three digits of the
        quotient, then turn the card over (where you have already written a
        prediction). He’ll be surprised to see that you’ve already written the
        number 1.61!

        To perform the quick calculation, you simply multiply the number on line
        7 by 11. Here 61 × 11 = 671. The reason this works is illustrated in the
        table below. If we denote the numbers on lines 1 and 2 by <em>×</em> and{" "}
        <em>y</em>, respectively, then the sum of lines 1 <a id="page205"></a>

        Are you ready for a challenge of a different sort? Below you will find
        what is called a magic square. There has been much written on magic
        squares and how to construct them, going back as far as ancient China.
        Here we describe a way to present magic squares in an entertaining
        fashion. This is a routine I’ve been doing for years.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        I bring out a business card with the following written on the back:

        I say, “This is called a magic square. In fact, it’s the smallest magic
        square you can create, using the numbers one through sixteen. You’ll
        notice that every row and every column adds to the same
        number—thirty-four. Now I’ve done such an extensive study on magic
        squares that I propose to create one for you right before your very
        eyes.”
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        I then ask someone from the audience to give me any number larger than
        34. Let’s suppose she says 67.

      <p className="indent">
        I then bring out another business card and draw a blank 4-by-4 grid, and
        place the number 67 to the right of it. Next I <a id="page207"></a>ask
        her to point to the squares, one at a time, in any order. As she points
        to an empty box, I immediately write a number inside it. The end result
        looks like this:

        I continue: “Now with the first magic square, every row and column added
        to thirty-four. [I usually put the thirty-four card away at this point.]
        Let’s see how we did with your square.” After checking that each row and
        column adds up to 67, I say: “But I did not stop there. For you, I
        decided to go one step further. Notice that both <em>diagonals</em> add
        up to sixty-seven!” Then I point out that the four squares in the{" "}
        <em>upper left corner</em> sum to 67 (16 + 19 + 22 + 10 = 67), as do the
        other three four-square corners, the four squares <em>in the middle</em>
        , and the four <em>corner squares</em>! “They all sum to sixty-seven.

        <strong>HOW TO CONSTRUCT A MAGIC SQUARE</strong>
      </h2>
      <p className="nonindent">
        You can create a magic square that sums to any number by taking
        advantage of the original magic square that sums to 34. Keep that square
        within eyeshot while you construct the volunteer’s magic square. As you
        draw the 4-by-4 grid, mentally perform the calculations of steps 1 and
        2:
      </p>
      <div className="block1">
        <p className="hanging">
          1. Subtract 34 from the given number (e.g., 67 − 34 = 33).
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">
          2. Divide this number by 4 (e.g., 33 ÷ 4 = 8 with a remainder of 1).{" "}
          <a id="page208"></a>The quotient is the first “magic” number. The
          quotient plus the remainder is the second “magic” number. (Here our
          magic numbers are 8 and 9.)
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">
          3. When the volunteer points out a square, inconspicuously look at the
          34-square and see what is in the corresponding square. If it is a 13,
          14, 15, or 16, add the second number to it (e.g., 9). If not, add the
          first magic number (e.g., 8).
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">
          4. Insert the appropriate number until the magic square is completed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        Note that when the given number is even, but not a multiple of 4, then
        your first and second magic numbers will be the same, so you’ll have
        just one magic number to add to the numbers in your 34-square.
      </p>
      <h3 className="section">
        <strong>Why This Trick Works</strong>
      </h3>
      <p className="nonindent">
        The reason this method works is based on the fact that every row,
        column, diagonal (and more) from the originally displayed magic square
        sums to 34. Suppose the given number had been 82. Since 82 − 34 = 48
        (and 48 ÷ 4 = 12), we would add 12 to each square. Then every group of
        four that had previously summed to 34 would add to 34 + 48 = 82. See the
        magic square below.

        On the other hand, if the given number were 85, our magic numbers would

        Once you have learned these, calculating the cube roots is as easy as p.
        For instance, with this example problem:
      </p>
      <p className="extract">
        <strong>
          <em>What is the cube root of 314,432?</em>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Seems like a pretty tough one to begin with, but don’t panic, it’s
        actually quite simple. As usual, we’ll take it one step at a time:
      </p>
      <div className="block1">
        <p className="hanging">
          1. Look at the magnitude of the thousands number (the numbers to the
          left of the comma), 314 in this example.
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">
          2. Since 314 lies between 6<sup className="frac">3</sup> = 216 and 7
          <sup className="frac">3</sup> = 343, the cube root lies in the 60s
          (since 60<sup className="frac">3</sup> = 216,000 and 70
          <sup className="frac">3</sup> = 343,000). Hence the first digit of the
          cube root is 6.
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">
          3. To determine the last digit of the cube root, note that only the
          number 8 has a cube that ends in 2 (8<sup className="frac">3</sup> =
          512), so the last digit ends in 8.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page211"></a>Therefore, the cube root of 314,432 is 68. Three
        simple steps and you’re there. Notice that every digit, 0 through 9,
        appears once among the last digits of the cubes. (In fact, the last
        digit of the cube root is equal to the last digit of the cube of the
        last digit of the cube. Go figure out that one!)
      </p>
      <p className="indent">Now you try one for practice:</p>
      <p className="extract">
        <strong>
          <em>What is the cube root of 19,683?</em>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <div className="block1">
        <p className="hanging">
          1. 19 lies between 8 and 27 (2<sup className="frac">3</sup> and 3
          <sup className="frac">3</sup>).
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">2. Therefore the cube root is 20-something.</p>
        <p className="hanging">
          3. The last digit of the problem is 3, which corresponds to 343 = 7
          <sup className="frac">3</sup>, so 7 is the last digit.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">The answer is 27.</p>
      <p className="indent">
        Notice that our derivation of the last digit will only work if the
        original number is the cube root of a whole number. For instance, the
        cube root of 19,684 is 27.0004572&#160;…&#160;definitely not 24. That’s
        why we included this in our mathemagical magic section and not in an
        earlier chapter. (Besides, the calculation goes so fast, it seems like
        magic!)

        <strong>SIMPLIFIED SQUARE ROOTS</strong>
      </h2>
      <p className="nonindent">
        Square roots can also be calculated easily if you are given a perfect
        square. For instance, if someone told you that the square of a two-digit
        number was 7569, you could immediately tell her that the original number
        (the square root) is 87. Here’s how.
      </p>
      <div className="block1">
        <p className="hanging">
          1. Look at the magnitude of the “hundreds number” (the numbers
          preceding the last two digits), 75 in this example.
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">
          2. Since 75 lies between 8<sup className="frac">2</sup> (8 × 8 = 64)
          and 9<sup className="frac">2</sup> (9 × 9 = 81), then we know that the
          square root lies in the 80s. Hence the first digit of{" "}
          <a id="page212"></a>the square root is 8. Now there are two numbers
          whose square ends in 9: 3<sup className="frac">2</sup> = 9 and 7
          <sup className="frac">2</sup> = 49. So the last digit must be 3 or 7.
          Hence the square root is either 83 or 87. Which one?
        </p>
        <p className="hanging">
          3. Compare the original number with the square of 85 (which we can
          easily compute as 80 × 90 + 25 = 7225. Since 7569 is larger than 7225,
          the square root is the larger number, 87.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="indent">Let’s do one more example.</p>
      <p className="extract">
        <strong>
          <em>What is the square root of 4761?</em>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Since 47 lies between 6<sup className="frac">2</sup> = 36 and 7
        <sup className="frac">2</sup> = 49, the answer must be in the 60s. Since
        the last digit of the square is 1, the last digit of the square root
        must be 1 or 9. Since 4761 is greater than 65
        <sup className="frac">2</sup> = 42 25, the square root must be 69. As
        with the previous cube root trick, this method can be applied only when

        numbers total to 17. With person C’s numbers in the right column
        totaling to 17, you will always put down the 7 and carry the 1. With
        person B’s numbers totaling to 23, plus the 1, you will always put down
        the 4 and carry the 2. Finally with person A’s numbers totaling to 20,

        <a id="page215"></a>I have found the above list to be easy to remember,

        three fingers, you get the letter <em>w</em>. For the weekends (at the

        Sunday as <em>7 day</em> (especially if you pronounce the <em>?</em>{" "}

        Next we need a code for every month of the year. These month codes are
        used for every year, with two exceptions. In a leap year (like 2000 or
        2004 or 2008 or …) the month code for January is 5, and the month code
        for February is 1. To make the month codes easier to remember, we

        Now let’s calculate the day of the week for any date in 2006. After
        that, we will describe 2007, then 2008, and so on, for the{" "}
        <a id="page216"></a>rest of your life. Once all future dates are taken
        care of, we can look back into the past and determine the days of the
        week for any date in the 1900s or any other century.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Every year is assigned a code number, and for 2006 that year code
        happens to be 0 (see{" "}
        <a className="hlink" href="#page218">
          this page
        </a>
        ).
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Now, to calculate the day of the week, you simply add the month code
        plus the date code plus the year code. Thus for December 3, 2006, we
        compute
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>Month Code + Date + Year Code = 4 + 3 + 0 = 7</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Hence, this date will be on Day 7, which is Sunday.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        How about November 18, 2006? Since November has a month code of 2, we
        have
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>Month Code + Date + Year Code = 2 + 18 + 0 = 20</strong>.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Now since the week repeats every seven days, we can subtract any
        multiple of 7 from our answer (7, 14, 21, 28, 35, …) and this will not
        change the day of the week. So our final step is to subtract the biggest
        multiple of 7 to get 20 − 14 = 6. Hence November 18, 2006, occurs on
        Saturday.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        How about 2007? Well, what happens to your birthday as you go from one
        year to the next? For most years, there are 365 days, and since 364 is a
        multiple of 7 (7 × 52 = 364), then the day of the week of your birthday
        will shift forward by one day in most years. If there are 366 days
        between your birthdays, then it will shift forward by two days. Hence,
        for 2007 we calculate the day of the week just as before, but now we use
        a year code of 1. Next, 2008 is a leap year. (Leap years occur every
        four years, so 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, …, 2096 are the leap years of the
        twenty-first century.) Hence, for 2008, the year <a id="page217"></a>
        code increases by two, so it will have a year code of 3. The next year,
        2009, is not a leap year, so the year code increases by one, to 4.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">Thus, for example, May 2, 2007, has</p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>Month Code + Date + Year Code = 0 + 2 + 1=3</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="nonindent">so this date is a Wednesday.</p>
      <p className="indent">For September 9, 2008, we have</p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>Month Code + Date + Year Code = 4 + 9 + 3= 16</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Subtracting the biggest multiple of 7, we have 16 − 14 = 2, so this date
        is a Tuesday.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        On the other hand, January 16, 2008, is a leap year January, so its
        month code will be 5 instead of 6. Thus, we have
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>Month Code + Date + Year Code = 5 + 16 + 3 = 24</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        and therefore occurs on day 24 − 21 = 3, which is Wednesday. For your
        reference, we have listed all of the year codes for the twenty-first
        century in the figure on the following page.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        The good news is that we do not have to memorize this table. We can
        mentally calculate the year code for any date between 2000 and 2099. For
        the year code of 2000 + <em>x</em>, we simply take the number x/4
        (ignoring any remainder) and add that to <em>x</em>. The year code can
        be reduced by subtracting any multiple of 7.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        For example, with 2061, we see that{" "}

          width="17"
        />{" "}
        = 15 (with a remainder of 1 that we ignore). Thus 2061 has a year code
        of 61 + 15 = 76. And since we can subtract any multiple of 7, we use the
        simpler year code of 76 − 70 = 6. <a id="page218"></a>

      <div className="dis_img">

          width="471"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="indent">Hence March 19, 2061, has</p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>Month Code + Date + Year Code = 2 + 19 + 6 = 27</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page219"></a>Subtracting 27 − 21 = 6 tells us that this date will
        take place on Saturday.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        What about birth dates between 1900 and 1999? Do the problem exactly as
        in the previous calculation, but shift the final answer forward by one
        day (or simply add 1 to the year code). Thus March 19, 1961, occurred on
        a Sunday.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        For the date December 3, 1998, we have{" "}
        <img
          alt=""
          height="25"
          src="/Static/images/Benj_9780307347466_epub_517_r1.jpg"
          width="17"
        />{" "}
        = 24 (with a remainder of 2 that we ignore). Thus 1998 has year code 98
        + 24 + 1 = 123, where the plus one is added for dates in the 1900s.
        Next, subtract the biggest multiple of 7. For handy reference, here are
        the multiples of 7 that you might need:
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>
          7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, 119,
          126, …
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Since 123 − 119 = 4, 1998 has a year code of 4. Therefore, December 3,
        1998, has
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>Month Code + Date + Year Code = 4 + 3 + 4 = 11</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="nonindent">
        and 11 − 7 = 4, so this date occurred on a Thursday.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        For dates in the 1800s, we add 3 to the year code. For example, Charles
        Darwin and Abraham Lincoln were both born on February 12, 1809. Since
        2009 has a year code of 4, then 1809 has a year code of 4 + 3 = 7, which
        can be reduced to 0. Thus, February 12, 1809, has
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>Month Code + Date + Year Code = 2 + 12 + 0= 14</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="nonindent">
        and 14 − 14 = 0, so they were both born on a Sunday.
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        <a id="page220"></a>For dates in the 2100s, we add 5 to the year code
        (or, equivalently, subtract 2 from the year code). For example, since
        2009 has a year code of 4, then 2109 has a year code of 4 + 5 = 9,
        which, after subtracting 7 is the same as a year code of 2. Dates in the
        1700s are treated just like in the 2100s (by adding 5 or subtracting 2)
        but we need to be careful. The days that we are calculating are based on
        the Gregorian calendar, established in 1582. But this calendar was not
        adopted by England (and the American colonies) until 1752, when
        Wednesday, September 2, was followed by Thursday, September 14. Let’s
        verify that September 14, 1752, was indeed a Thursday. Since 2052 has a
        year code of 2 (from{" "}
        <a className="hlink" href="#page218">
          this page
        </a>
        , or by 52 + 13 − 63 = 2), then 1752 has a year code of 0. Thus
        September 14, 1752, has
      </p>
      <p className="center">
        <strong>Month Code + Date + Year Code = 4 + 14 + 0= 18</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="nonindent">
        and 18 − 14 = 4, so it was indeed a Thursday. However, our formula will
        not work for earlier dates (which were governed by the Julian calendar).
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        Finally, we remark that under the Gregorian calendar, a leap year occurs
        every four years, with the exception of years that are divisible by 100,
        although there is an exception to the exception: years divisible by 400
        are leap years. Thus 1600, 2000, 2400, and 2800 are leap years, but
        1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not leap years. In
        fact, the Gregorian calendar repeats every 400 years, so you can convert
        any future date into a date near 2000. For example, March 19, 2361, and
        March 19, 2761, will have the same day of the week as March 19, 1961,
        which, as we already determined, is a Sunday. <a id="page221"></a>
